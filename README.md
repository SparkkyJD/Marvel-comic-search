# Marvel Comic Long Box

## Description
This project began with the goal of creating an application that will assist Marvel comic fans in putting together a virtual long box collection. The applicaiton serves to help the user keep a visual of what comics they are collecting. The user can search for a comic title they own, and add it to their virtual collection. This helps users quickly visualize their collection, without having to sift through their in-person collection. If the user is curious about obtaining more information, the search can be entered into the "search wikipedia bar" and upon searching you will be redirected to recieve that information.

## Installation
All that is required is a device that has access to an internet browser.

## Usage
Upon loading the application, you will be brought to the search page.

In the drop down menu to the left of the search, select to search by title or year, and begin typing your search into the text box.

You can then press search or hit enter to begin the search and the comic results will then be generated onto the page.

To save a comic result, click the button in the top right of that result, and it will be saved to the browser's local storage.

The saved comics can be seen within the "My Longbox" section. You can find this section by clicking the text in the top right of the page, and you will be redirected to the gallery page.

Here, any comics saved to the local storage will be displayed onto the page.

The comics in the long box gallery will each have a button in the top right to remove them from the gallery and local storage.

This way, you can manipulate the long box as you please.

To obtain more information about your search, enter it into the "search wikipedia" bar. Then, click search or hit enter, and you will be redirected to a wikipedia page containing additional information about the search.
